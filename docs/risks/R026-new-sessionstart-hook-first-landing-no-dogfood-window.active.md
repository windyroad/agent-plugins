## Description

New SessionStart nudge hook (architect-oversight-nudge.sh) lands direct into package without held-area dogfood; R003 new-hook modulator + absent dogfood control hold commit/push residual at 8/25 Medium. Distinct from R020 (PreToolUse:Bash gate class) — this is the SessionStart additionalContext class with exit-0-always self-suppressing envelope.

## Recogniser

**Path patterns** (any match → consider this entry):

- `packages/*/hooks/*.sh` (new file, SessionStart event)
- `packages/*/hooks/*-nudge.sh`, `packages/*/hooks/*-oversight*.sh` (canonical SessionStart nudge naming)
- `packages/*/hooks/hooks.json` (new SessionStart event registration)
- `.changeset/*.md` paired with new SessionStart hook AND no `docs/changesets-holding/` sibling

**Diff-content keywords** (any match → consider):

- `SessionStart`
- `additionalContext`, `hookSpecificOutput`
- `nudge`, `oversight`
- `exit 0` self-suppressing envelope on the SessionStart path
- new-file additions under `packages/*/hooks/` declaring `SessionStart`

**Anti-patterns** (looks like R026 but isn't):

- PreToolUse:Bash matcher (not SessionStart) → score as **R020** Bash-gate class instead
- PreToolUse:Edit/Write hook → score as **R015** generic new-hook class
- Existing SessionStart hook *modification* → standard **R003** (no first-landing modulator)
- New SessionStart hook WITH paired `docs/changesets-holding/` dogfood window → controls firing
