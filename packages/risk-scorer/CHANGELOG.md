# @windyroad/risk-scorer

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8a15336: Fix `--update` flag failing with "Plugin not found" (P025). The `updatePlugin` command was missing the `@windyroad` marketplace suffix and `--scope project`, causing all `npx @windyroad/<pkg> --update` invocations to fail. The correct command is now used: `claude plugin update "<name>@windyroad" --scope project`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b7d6739: Add on-demand assessment skills (P020)

  New user-invocable skills per ADR-015:

  - `wr-risk-scorer:assess-release` — pipeline risk score on demand; pre-satisfies the commit gate
  - `wr-risk-scorer:assess-wip` — WIP risk nudge for the current uncommitted diff
  - `wr-architect:review-design` — on-demand ADR compliance review
  - `wr-jtbd:review-jobs` — on-demand persona/job alignment check

  All four skills are discoverable via `/` autocomplete and delegate to existing
  governance subagents. No hook gate changes; bypass marker is still written by
  the PostToolUse hook after the pipeline subagent runs.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 23d0d10: Require structured `AskUserQuestion` prompts at all governance-skill decision branches (P021, ADR-013).

  **@windyroad/itil**: `manage-problem` skill now requires `AskUserQuestion` for WSJF tie-breaks, problem selection, and scope-change decisions. Prose "(a)/(b)/(c)" option lists are prohibited.

  **@windyroad/risk-scorer**: All three scorer agents (pipeline, wip, plan) now enforce below-appetite silence — no advisory prose, "Your call:", or suggestions when scores are within appetite. Above-appetite output uses structured `RISK_REMEDIATIONS:` blocks instead of free-text suggestions.

  New ADR-013 establishes the cross-cutting standard: every governance-skill branch point with ≥2 options must use `AskUserQuestion`; scoring agents stay pure output-only.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe1b903: Gate markers now persist across prompts (ADR-009). Removed Stop-hook reset scripts from all 5 review plugins. Marker lifecycle is now governed entirely by TTL (30 min default, configurable via `*_TTL` env vars) + drift detection of policy files. Resolves P001 — reviews no longer need to re-run on every prompt. Note: this is a behaviour change; users who relied on fresh-review-every-prompt should set a shorter TTL.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- ec16630: Add project-root check to all enforce hooks (P004). Absolute file paths outside the current project (e.g., ~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json) are no longer gated — gates now only fire on files within the project root.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- b12e7c0: Fix misleading error messages in release gate: drift now clearly instructs "re-run risk-scorer", score-too-high retains "split/reduce/incident" guidance inline. Remove generic suffix in git-push-gate that conflated the two cases.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 7ee97ba: Add README.md to every package and rewrite the root README with better engagement, problem statement, and project-scoped install documentation.
- eb47a86: Improve git-push-gate hook to detect missing release:watch script and guide the agent to create one instead of directing to a non-existent command.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- eda2a15: Fix release preview to use pre-release versions (e.g., 0.1.2-preview.42) instead of exact release versions, preventing version collision with changeset publish.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- a4cbfd9: Fix misleading error messages in risk-gate.sh that said the risk-scorer "runs automatically on each prompt". It doesn't — the agent must explicitly delegate to wr-risk-scorer:pipeline.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3833199: Fix: bundle shared install utilities into each package so bin scripts work when installed via npx.
