## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 359ec7c: ticket-creators: next-ID collision guard against origin (P043)

  Adds the next-ID collision guard from ADR-019 confirmation criterion 2 to
  both ticket-creator skills:

  - `manage-problem` step 3 (Assign the next ID): now computes max of
    local-max and `git ls-tree origin/<base>` max, then increments. Catches
    collisions between local work and parallel sessions before the ticket
    file is written.
  - `create-adr` step 3 (Determine sequence number): same mechanism applied
    to `docs/decisions/`.

  Both skills cite ADR-019 and log renumber decisions in the user-facing
  report. Sibling fix to P040 (work-problems Step 0 preflight, shipped in
  @windyroad/itil@0.4.2): preflight catches divergence at loop start; this
  ticket catches collisions at ticket-creation time as a defence in depth.

  Adds bats tests (3 assertions per skill) verifying ADR-019 references and
  the collision-guard pattern.

  Closes P043 pending user verification.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8a15336: Fix `--update` flag failing with "Plugin not found" (P025). The `updatePlugin` command was missing the `@windyroad` marketplace suffix and `--scope project`, causing all `npx @windyroad/<pkg> --update` invocations to fail. The correct command is now used: `claude plugin update "<name>@windyroad" --scope project`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b7d6739: Add on-demand assessment skills (P020)

  New user-invocable skills per ADR-015:

  - `wr-risk-scorer:assess-release` — pipeline risk score on demand; pre-satisfies the commit gate
  - `wr-risk-scorer:assess-wip` — WIP risk nudge for the current uncommitted diff
  - `wr-architect:review-design` — on-demand ADR compliance review
  - `wr-jtbd:review-jobs` — on-demand persona/job alignment check

  All four skills are discoverable via `/` autocomplete and delegate to existing
  governance subagents. No hook gate changes; bypass marker is still written by
  the PostToolUse hook after the pipeline subagent runs.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe1b903: Gate markers now persist across prompts (ADR-009). Removed Stop-hook reset scripts from all 5 review plugins. Marker lifecycle is now governed entirely by TTL (30 min default, configurable via `*_TTL` env vars) + drift detection of policy files. Resolves P001 — reviews no longer need to re-run on every prompt. Note: this is a behaviour change; users who relied on fresh-review-every-prompt should set a shorter TTL.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- ec16630: Add project-root check to all enforce hooks (P004). Absolute file paths outside the current project (e.g., ~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json) are no longer gated — gates now only fire on files within the project root.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- dbb2e79: Exempt peer-plugin policy files from architect gate (P009): docs/JOBS_TO_BE_DONE.md, docs/PRODUCT_DISCOVERY.md, docs/jtbd/, docs/VOICE-AND-TONE.md, docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md. Each plugin governs its own policy files — the architect should not re-gate them.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 7ee97ba: Add README.md to every package and rewrite the root README with better engagement, problem statement, and project-scoped install documentation.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- eda2a15: Fix release preview to use pre-release versions (e.g., 0.1.2-preview.42) instead of exact release versions, preventing version collision with changeset publish.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3833199: Fix: bundle shared install utilities into each package so bin scripts work when installed via npx.
