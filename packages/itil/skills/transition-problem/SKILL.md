# Transition Problem — Lifecycle Advance

Advance a specific problem ticket along the ITIL lifecycle: Open → Known Error → Verification Pending → Closed. The skill is the **authoritative executor** for the user-initiated transition path — it identifies the ticket and the destination status, then executes the transition inline: pre-flight checks, external-root-cause detection (P063), `git mv` + Status edit with staging re-stage (P057), `## Fix Released` section write for the `verifying` destination, README.md refresh (P062), and ADR-014 commit.

This skill is phase 4 of the P071 phased-landing split of `/wr-itil:manage-problem <NNN> <status>` per ADR-010's amended Skill Granularity rule (one skill per distinct user intent). Per ADR-010's "Split-skill execution ownership" rule (P093), the skill does **not** re-invoke `/wr-itil:manage-problem` to run Step 7 (no round-trip); the deprecation-window forwarder on manage-problem routes one-way to this skill and returns its output verbatim. The in-skill Step 7 block on manage-problem remains in place for in-skill callers (Step 9b auto-transition, Parked path, Step 9d closure inside review) — "copy, not move" per ADR-010 amended.

The deprecated `/wr-itil:manage-problem <NNN> known-error` subcommand route remains as a one-way forwarder during the deprecation window but is scheduled for removal in `@windyroad/itil`'s next major version.

## Arguments

- `<NNN>` — the ticket ID (data parameter, e.g. `042`). Required.
- `<status>` — the destination status. One of:
  - `known-error` — Open → Known Error (root cause confirmed, fix path clear, fix not yet released).
  - `verifying` — Known Error → Verification Pending (fix released, awaiting user verification per ADR-022).
  - `close` — Verification Pending → Closed (user has confirmed the fix works in production).

The `<NNN>` and `<status>` tokens are **data parameters**, not word-subcommands. Per the P071 split rule (ADR-010 amended), data parameters (IDs, paths, URLs, enum destinations) are permitted; word-subcommands that name distinct user intents are not. This skill's argument shape is `data + data`, which is the same shape as `/wr-itil:report-upstream <NNN>`.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Validate that the ticket file exists and the destination status is reachable from the current status (e.g. an `.open.md` file cannot transition directly to Verification Pending — it must go through Known Error first).
- Execute the transition inline: pre-flight checks, P063 external-root-cause detection (for the Open → Known Error destination), `git mv` to the new suffix, Status field edit, `## Fix Released` section write (for the Known Error → Verification Pending destination), P057 staging re-stage, P062 README.md refresh, ADR-014 commit.
- Report the outcome (new filename, new Status, commit SHA).

**Out of scope:**
- Backlog re-ranking — that's `/wr-itil:review-problems`.
- Ticket creation or bare-update flows — that's `/wr-itil:manage-problem` (no-args form for creation, `<NNN>` bare for update).
- Parking a ticket — that's a distinct lifecycle move handled by `/wr-itil:manage-problem` directly (the `.parked.md` suffix has its own pre-flight path including P063 external-root-cause detection for `upstream-blocked` reasons).
- Auto-transitions fired inside `/wr-itil:review-problems` Step 9b (Open → Known Error when root cause + workaround are documented) — those use manage-problem's in-skill Step 7 block per ADR-010 amended "Split-skill execution ownership" ("copy, not move").

## Steps

### 1. Parse the arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`, extract the ticket ID (`<NNN>`, three digits) and the destination status (one of `known-error`, `verifying`, `close`). If either is missing or malformed, emit a usage message and stop:

```
Usage: /wr-itil:transition-problem <NNN> <status>
  <NNN>    — three-digit ticket ID (e.g. 042)
  <status> — one of: known-error, verifying, close
```

### 2. Discover the ticket file

Locate the ticket file by ID:

```bash
ls docs/problems/<NNN>-*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If no file is found, emit: `No ticket found for ID <NNN>` and stop.

If multiple files are found (should not happen — suffix-exclusive lifecycle), emit a warning and list the matches; stop and let the user resolve.

### 3. Validate the transition path

Check the current filename suffix and verify the destination status is reachable in one step:

| Current suffix | Destination argument | Valid? |
|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| `.open.md` | `known-error` | yes |
| `.known-error.md` | `verifying` | yes |
| `.verifying.md` | `close` | yes |
| any other pairing | — | no — emit an error and stop |

If the pairing is invalid, emit a clear message naming the current status, the requested destination, and the valid next step. Do not silently skip or auto-correct — invalid transitions are almost always user typos and a clear error is the cheapest recovery.

### 4. Run pre-flight checks

Destination-specific pre-flight checks gate the transition. If any check fails, report which ones and stop — do not auto-remediate.

**Open → Known Error** (`<status>` = `known-error`) requires:

- [ ] Root cause is documented in the Root Cause Analysis section (not just "Preliminary Hypothesis")
- [ ] At least one investigation task is checked off
- [ ] A reproduction test exists or is referenced
- [ ] A workaround is documented (even if "feature disabled")
- [ ] Effort bucket re-rated against the now-documented fix strategy; if the bucket changed since creation, update the Effort / WSJF lines and note the reason (P047 — creation-time estimates drift as scope clarifies)

**Known Error → Verification Pending** (`<status>` = `verifying`) requires:

- [ ] The fix has been implemented (the transition typically rides with the `fix(<scope>): ... (closes P<NNN>)` commit)
- [ ] A release marker is available (version, commit SHA, or date) so the `## Fix Released` section can name it

**Verification Pending → Closed** (`<status>` = `close`) requires:

- [ ] The user has explicitly confirmed the fix works in production (this skill never auto-closes on inference — only on explicit user confirmation or orchestrator-supplied `close` argument)

### 5. External-root-cause detection (P063 — Open → Known Error only)

Fires on the Open → Known Error transition only. Parking with the `upstream-blocked` reason reuses the same mechanism but is handled by `/wr-itil:manage-problem`'s Step 7 (this skill does not park).

**Strict detection tokens** (any of the following within the Root Cause Analysis section counts as a hit):

- Literal label words: `upstream`, `third-party`, `external`, `vendor`.
- Scoped npm package pattern: `@[\w-]+/[\w-]+` (e.g. `@anthropic/claude-code`, `@windyroad/itil`).

Bash heuristic:

```bash
if grep -iE '\b(upstream|third-party|external|vendor)\b|@[[:alnum:]_-]+/[[:alnum:]_-]+' "$problem_file"; then
  external_root_cause_detected=1
fi
```

Detection is intentionally **strict** (explicit label or scoped-npm package only) to avoid prompt fatigue (P063 Direction decision). A passing reference to a bare package name (`gh`, `npm`) does NOT trigger the prompt.

**Already-noted check** — before firing the prompt, grep the ticket for the stable marker `- **Upstream report pending** —` (written by option 2 / the AFK fallback below) or `- **Reported Upstream:**` / a `## Reported Upstream` section (written by `/wr-itil:report-upstream` Step 7 back-write per ADR-024 Confirmation criterion 3a). If any of those are already present, skip the prompt — the detection has already fired on a prior run.

**If the detection fires and nothing has been noted yet** (per ADR-044 framework-resolution boundary): the agent applies the AFK fallback default WITHOUT firing `AskUserQuestion`. Per ADR-044, this decision IS framework-resolved — the safe action is "defer and note marker", and the user can correct via authentic-correction (ADR-044 category 6) if a manual `/wr-itil:report-upstream` invocation is wanted instead. Per-transition `AskUserQuestion` for upstream-detection is sub-contracting framework-resolved decisions back to the user (lazy deferral per Step 2d Ask Hygiene Pass classification).

**Default behaviour (silent agent action, per ADR-044)**: append the pending-upstream-report line to the ticket's `## Related` section using the stable marker:

```
- **Upstream report pending** — external dependency identified; invoke /wr-itil:report-upstream when ready
```

The marker wording is fixed so subsequent runs (and the work-problems `upstream-blocked` skip path) can detect "already noted" without re-firing. The transition proceeds normally after the marker is appended.

**Recovery / override paths** (user-initiated, not asked-per-transition):

- If the detection misfired (false positive — not actually upstream), user appends `- **Upstream report pending** — false positive; detection misfire` directly to the ticket's `## Related` section. The next detection-pass observes the marker and skips firing again.
- If the user wants to invoke `/wr-itil:report-upstream` immediately rather than deferring, they invoke it directly (`/wr-itil:report-upstream <NNN> <upstream-repo-url>`). The skill writes the `## Reported Upstream` appendage per ADR-024.

**AFK and interactive modes use identical behaviour** — the silent-default-with-recovery-path shape is the framework-resolution boundary application; there's no `AskUserQuestion`-vs-fallback differentiation.

### 6. Rename the file, edit content, and re-stage (P057 staging trap)

Per destination, run the rename + edit + explicit re-stage sequence. The explicit re-stage after `Edit` is mandatory — without it the content edit leaks into the next commit and the audit trail breaks.

> **Staging trap (P057).** `git mv` stages only the rename — it does NOT pick up subsequent `Edit`-tool content changes. After the `Edit` tool modifies the renamed file (Status field, `## Fix Released` section, etc.), re-stage it explicitly: `git add <new>`. Without the explicit re-stage, the transition commit captures the rename-only change and the content edit leaks into the next commit, corrupting the audit trail.

**Open → Known Error**:

```bash
git mv docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.open.md docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.known-error.md
# ... use the Edit tool to update the Status field to "Known Error" ...
git add docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.known-error.md
```

**Known Error → Verification Pending** (per ADR-022, on release):

```bash
git mv docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.known-error.md docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.verifying.md
# ... use the Edit tool to update Status to "Verification Pending" AND add the `## Fix Released` section ...
git add docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.verifying.md
```

The `## Fix Released` section contains: release marker (version, commit SHA, or date), one-sentence fix summary, "Awaiting user verification" line, and any exercise evidence from the releasing session. The `.verifying.md` suffix signals to every downstream consumer (work-problems classifier, review step 9d, README rendering) that the remaining work is user-side verification — no file-body scan needed.

When this transition is folded into a `fix(<scope>): ... (closes P<NNN>)` commit (the common case), the `git mv` + `Edit` + re-stage + README refresh all join that single commit — never split across commits.

**Verification Pending → Closed**:

```bash
git mv docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.verifying.md docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.closed.md
# ... use the Edit tool to update the Status field to "Closed" ...
git add docs/problems/<NNN>-<title>.closed.md
```

### 7. Refresh docs/problems/README.md (P062)

Every Step 7 status transition regenerates `docs/problems/README.md` and stages it in the same commit so the dev-work table, Verification Queue, Parked section, and "Last reviewed" line never lag the on-disk ticket inventory. Without this step, README.md accumulates staleness between review invocations.

The refresh uses the same rendering rules as `/wr-itil:review-problems` Step 9e (glob `docs/problems/*.open.md` / `*.known-error.md` / `*.verifying.md` / `*.parked.md`; rank open/known-error by WSJF; list verifyings in the Verification Queue ordered by release age; list parkeds in the Parked section) but skips the full re-scoring pass — existing WSJF values on the ticket files are trusted. The refresh is a render, not a re-rank.

**Mechanism:**

1. After renaming + Editing + `git add`-ing the transitioned ticket file (per the staging-trap rule above), regenerate `docs/problems/README.md` in-place reflecting the new filename set and the transitioned ticket's new Status.
2. `git add docs/problems/README.md` — stage the refreshed README with the same commit as the transition.
3. Update the "Last reviewed" line's parenthetical to name the transition (e.g. `P<NNN> <status> — <one-line fix summary>`) so the next session's fast-path check has a human-readable audit marker alongside the git-history staleness test.

### 8. Commit per ADR-014

Governance skills commit their own work. Transition commits include the renamed ticket file + any content edits + the refreshed `docs/problems/README.md`.

**Commit gate** — satisfy via one of two paths (either produces a bypass marker):

- **Primary**: delegate to subagent type `wr-risk-scorer:pipeline` via the Agent tool.
- **Fallback**: if `wr-risk-scorer:pipeline` is not available in the current tool set (e.g. this skill is running inside a spawned subagent), invoke `/wr-risk-scorer:assess-release` via the Skill tool. Per ADR-015 it wraps the same pipeline subagent and the `PostToolUse:Agent` hook writes an equivalent bypass marker. Do not silently skip the gate because the primary path is unavailable — the fallback exists specifically to close this gap (see P035).

**Commit message conventions**:

- Open → Known Error transition (standalone): `docs(problems): P<NNN> known error — <root cause summary>`
- Known Error → Verification Pending (folded with fix): `fix(<scope>): <description> (closes P<NNN>)` — per ADR-022, include the rename-to-`.verifying.md` + `## Fix Released` section in the same commit
- Known Error → Verification Pending (standalone, no fix riding with it): `docs(problems): P<NNN> verification pending — <release marker>`
- Verification Pending → Closed: `docs(problems): close P<NNN> <title>`

If risk is above appetite and `AskUserQuestion` is available: ask whether to commit anyway, remediate first, or park the work. If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable (AFK), skip the commit and report the uncommitted state (ADR-013 Rule 6 fail-safe). This applies only to the risk-above-appetite branch, not to the delegation-unavailable case above.

### 9. Report the outcome

Report: ticket ID, previous Status, new Status, new filename, commit SHA. If the destination was `verifying`, name the `## Fix Released` section's release marker so the user can correlate with the shipped version.

Release draining is owned by the caller — `/wr-itil:manage-problem` Step 12 (interactive) or the `/wr-itil:work-problems` orchestrator (AFK, Step 6.5 cadence). This skill does not invoke `npm run push:watch` / `release:watch` on its own.

## Ownership boundary

`transition-problem` owns (for the user-initiated transition path):
- Argument parsing (`<NNN> <status>`).
- Ticket-file discovery via `ls docs/problems/<NNN>-*.md`.
- Destination-reachability validation (Open → Known Error → Verification Pending → Closed, one step at a time).
- Pre-flight checks for the supplied destination.
- P063 external-root-cause detection (Open → Known Error only) — including the AFK fallback that appends the stable `- **Upstream report pending** —` marker.
- `git mv` rename + Status field edit + (for `verifying`) `## Fix Released` section write + explicit P057 re-stage.
- `docs/problems/README.md` refresh (P062) staged alongside the transition.
- ADR-014 commit through the risk-scorer commit gate.

`transition-problem` does NOT:
- Re-invoke `/wr-itil:manage-problem` to run Step 7 — the deprecation-window forwarder on manage-problem is one-way (P093 / ADR-010 amended "Split-skill execution ownership", no round-trip).
- Re-rank the backlog — that's `/wr-itil:review-problems`.
- Create tickets or run the bare-`<NNN>` update flow — those stay on `/wr-itil:manage-problem`.
- Park tickets — the `.parked.md` suffix has its own path on `/wr-itil:manage-problem` (P063 AFK fallback fires there too).
- Auto-transition inside review — Step 9b's Open → Known Error auto-transition uses manage-problem's in-skill Step 7 block ("copy, not move").
- Drain the release queue — `push:watch` / `release:watch` are owned by the caller (`/wr-itil:manage-problem` Step 12, or the `/wr-itil:work-problems` orchestrator).
